# TODO:
- display search results
  - paginate search results
- check for login status when popup.html page is opened
  - don't display sign-in button if already logged in
- clean up code organization
- log-in persistence doesn't work as expected

# searching for URLs should use lucene syntax instead of plain
# append `return true;` to onMessage event handler for async
# Have to use snoowrap_requester.then() to deal with async issues
# Snoowrap can work with installed apps :)
- snoowrap.getAuthUrl
- snoowrap.fromAuthCode
# Source node_modules `browserify popup.js -o b_popup.js`
# Install dependencies with `sudo npm install snoowrap --save`
# How to test shit
- Edit scratch.js
- Open scratch.html in browser
# Version of Snoowrap
