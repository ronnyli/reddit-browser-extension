# TODO:
- posting kind of works. Need to make it consistent
  * extension popup refreshes itself and console.logs the buttons again. Why? I think snoowrap triggers it.
  * need to press Submit Post twice to trigger the post?
- login does not persist across sessions
  * double-check snoowrap_requester will automatically refresh upon expiration
- search for posts based on current tab URL
- make errors from failed posts visible (rate limit, etc.)


# Have to use snoowrap_requester.then() to deal with async issues
# Snoowrap can work with installed apps :)
- snoowrap.getAuthUrl
- snoowrap.fromAuthCode
# Source node_modules `browserify popup.js -o b_popup.js`
# Install dependencies with `sudo npm install snoowrap --save`
# How to test shit
- Edit scratch.js
- Open scratch.html in browser
# Version of Snoowrap
